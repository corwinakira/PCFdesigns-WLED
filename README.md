PCFdesigns WLED - Instructions for Lamps and Controllers

In partnership with my daughter acting as PCFdesigns, we've been making numerous lamps and other display items utilizing the excellent WLED software for the ESP8266 and ESP32 micrcontrollers. I've been handling all the electronics, while she has been assisting with resin pours and artistic critiques.

To assist recipients of our artistic illuminations with engaging with WLED software for the first time, I've assembled some usage guides for our different lamps and WS2812B/RGBWW controller boards.
